        <h1>About Me</h1>
            
        <p>My name is Aaron Abramson. I am originally from Los Angeles where I had a 12 year career in IT at various companies and projects. 
            I moved to the Central Valley with my girlfriend in May of 2021 and in April 2022 I decided to go back to school to pursue a new career in programming.</p>
        <p>I have always been fascinated with technology at a young age and enjoyed building computers and working with gadgets. I hope that by going back to school I can 
            develop a comprehensive understanding of computer technology and transition into a career that is focused on programming, automation, and data science.</p>
        <p>I enjoy videogames, traveling with my girlfriend, photography, and trying new foods.</p>
